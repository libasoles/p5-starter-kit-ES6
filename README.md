# Starter kit for p5 projects with ES6 support

A simple project to get you started with processing ([**p5**](https://p5js.org)) running on a webpack server, with **ES6** and _scss_ support.

Why this? Basically, because you can benefit from working with js modules for medium size projects, instead of dealing with old js _global scope_ (from ES5).

## Requirements

You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system.

## Install

`npm install`

## Build

Give right permissions to _./build_ folder and execute:

`npm run build`

## Serve

`npm start`

Will listen to [http://localhost:7800/](http://localhost:7800)

You should see a white circle over a black background.
